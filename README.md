TBD

## TODO

Giovanni

*	Add dataset to repo and update this file (remove the not used annotation scheme, position 3 in a split)
*	How to share pretrained vectors? is it worth it? Zenodo is an option.
*   Paper writing
*   Tensorflow code
*   Check everything

Danny

*   Create high-res (vector) figures (and fix the fontsize of some of them!)
*	Check paper as I write, I am adding small TODOs there!
*   Prepare a data analysis notebook with a selection of results (esp. from 0. Data Analysis, Appendix C)
*   Push (in a separate branch) the clean Keras code (for single and multi task)
*   Add info on how to use it in the README
*   Provide some more on error analysis (examples of miss-classified instances, etc.). TO BE DISCUSSED first
